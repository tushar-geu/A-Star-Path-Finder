# A-Star-Path-Finder

This is a simple GUI based depiction of how the A-Star algorithm works to find the shortest path between two nodes. The implementation is done in python (pygame) . A 50 X 50 grid is created in which the user selects two grids representing the source and the destination node. The user can draw obstacles in the path and when the algorithm runs it determines the shortest path between the source and the destination node.
